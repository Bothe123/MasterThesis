% Field: Description of Stochastical systems -> random walk models first by pearson -> Levy walks
The L\'evy walk is a space-time coupled \gls{ctrw} that was first presented in \cite{shlesinger1987} as a way to model the anomalous diffusion found by Richardson \cite{richardson}: When studying turbulent flow in the atmosphere he observed that a particles \gsl{msd} would diffuse with a cubic time dependence $\mean{x^2} \propto t^3$, the so called Richardson regime.\\

The L\'evy walk had two distinguishing properties 

Continuous time random walks are frequently used to model and understand stochastic processes. Of particular interest for this thesis 

% introduced by klafter for turbulent flow (good for finite moments

% many more applications 

% some modifications -> overall successful

% studied in detail -> magdziarz carries for nu=1

% Radons ruins it

% new model 

% Does it cure it? If it does, how does it behave?
