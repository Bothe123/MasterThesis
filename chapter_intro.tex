% Field: Description of Stochastical systems -> random walk models first by pearson -> Levy walks
Random walks have long been used to model and understand stochastic processes. Ever since they were first formulated by Pearson \cite{pearson} they have been developed further 


% introduced by klafter for turbulent flow (good for finite moments

% many more applications 

% some modifications -> overall successful

% studied in detail -> magdziarz carries for nu=1

% Radons ruins it

% new model 

% Does it cure it? If it does, how does it behave?
